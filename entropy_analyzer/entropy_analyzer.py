Entropy Analyzer Module.

This module provides the main interface for entropy analysis across different
data types. It serves as the primary entry point for the entropy analysis
system, coordinating between different entropy calculation strategies.

The module is designed to be:
- User-friendly: Simple interface for entropy analysis.
- Versatile: Supports multiple data types.
- Extensible: Easy to add new analysis capabilities.
